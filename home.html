            Pizza (Italian: ['pittsa], Neapolitan: ['pitts…ô]) is a savory dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually
    
            round, flattened base
    
            of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients (such as
    
            anchovies, mushrooms, onions,
    
            olives, pineapple, meat, etc.), which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired
    
            oven.[1] A small pizza is
    
            sometimes called a pizzetta. A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.
